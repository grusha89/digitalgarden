##### Ceska Sporitelna
* Bank API endpoint Get authorization URL ([https://axway0csasmyaggregationv1.docs.apiary.io/reference/multibanking-api/authorization-url/get-authorization-url](https://axway0csasmyaggregationv1.docs.apiary.io/reference/multibanking-api/authorization-url/get-authorization-url) )has new query parameter:
		* forcePrompt - Currently works only for CSAS, forces consent screen to appear every time
	    * Example:_ true.
	    * Boolean
    
We has to add forcePrompt=true to request what solve this use case:
- User needs to establish connection to different bank accounts from multipple wflow organizations.
	* Current behavior:
    
    1. the user connects first wflow organization to bank and grants permition to access to bank account (from many bank accounts) on consent screen
        
    2. user connect second wflow organization to bank with the same credentials but consent screen doesn’t appear so user can’t grant permition to another bank account
        
    * Expected behavior (with forcePrompt=true in query):
    
    1. the same as current behavior
        
    2. user connect second wflow organization to bank with the same credentials and consent screen appears (already granted access to bank account from step 1. is shown there) and user can grant permission to access to another bank account. User shouldn’t uncheck granted access to bank account from step 1.
        
NOTE:
It works for ČSAS only now.
