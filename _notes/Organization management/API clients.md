"What is API Client for?
he API Client provides you with the ability for third parties to access your data through the public wflow API. API Client ensures access authentication. In order for communication to work properly, the API client needs to be granted (authorize) access at the organization level + external link (https://developers.wflow.com/docs/wflowapidoc/9408cca5f1d4a-using-api#application-client-registration)"
