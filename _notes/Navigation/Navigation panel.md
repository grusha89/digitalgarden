### Navigation behavior

**Default state** – the workspace navigation (contextual, e.g., Documents, Storage, or Finance) is closed.

**When the page is reloaded** (e.g., F5 or browser refresh) – the last state is remembered.

**When clicking a link in the navigation panel** (that changes the context) – redirection occurs and the workspace navigation opens.

**When clicking a link within the same context as the current one** – the navigation opens.

**When redirected (without interacting with the navigation panel) to a different context** (e.g., Search) – the navigation opens.

**When redirected (without interacting with the navigation panel) to the same context** (e.g., Search) – the navigation does not open.
