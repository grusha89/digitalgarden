### For Incoming invoice and Receipt**

It is possible to generate PDF when the following conditions are met:
1. There is no PDF as the main file or there is a file that we are not able to display (for example ISDOC)
2. Document has flow status "Filled" and higher and is not locked

Created PDF automatically becomes main file


### For manual Outgoing Invoices and Orders

If document already has generated PDF and user wants to generate new PDF with edited data -> the old PDF remains, new PDF will be marked as main file
