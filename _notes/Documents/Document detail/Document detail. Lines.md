### Working with lines

##### Copy, Delete
* Each line has "Copy" and "Delete" buttons
* Buttons appear on hover or when the line is focused
* "Copy" button creates identical copy of the line with all values
* "Button" removes the line and the order of the lines is automatically recalculated
	* e.g. if you have three lines and you delete the second one, the third line automatically gets the order number "2"

##### Value stretch
* User can stretch the values in the columns to another lines (same as in EXCEL table)
	* it helps to copy the same value for the same column for other lines
* Stretching can be done vi dragging the right bottom corner of the cell 


##### Add item
* Button that adds a new line 
* If the total amount is filled: line will be added with corresponding amount, price per unit and total amount + VAT type
* if the document's total amount consists of the different VAT types - the separate line will be created for each VAT type
* if the total amount fully matches to the added lines, the next added line will be with Total amount = 0


> [!NOTE] Manual Outgoing Invoice and Order
> The lines are not automatically filled with amounts based on the total amount and recapitulation. It works vise versa: Total amount and the recapitulation are being filled on the base of the added lines, as this document kinds have recapitulation and total amount fields read only [[Document detail. Orders]] 

##### Add from template
* Button that is hidden in the button selector
* Button opens the "Pick template" selector
* Selector input is required and has validation for empty value
* Drop down displayed the list of the templates (10 per page)
	* each template is displayed with the name and the method of use
		* Values 
		* Percent 
	* Button "Next" is displayed to upload the further templates
	* full text search is implemented
* Button "Pick" is always active but it doesn't work when the template is not selected
* The lines from the selected template are being added to the existing lines

> [!important] Value vs Percent 
Value:
> * each line in template has certain selected amount, price per unit and total amount
> * the exact amounts are transferred to the document detail
> 
Percent:
> * each lines in template has only selected percent of the total amount (which is unknow)
> * when the template is applied to the document, lines will get the amounts based on the calculation of its percent from the total amount of the document and recapitulation
> * E.g. We have percent template with two lines with the Basic VAT type. We set 70% for the first line and 30% for the second. When we apply the template for the document that has total amount 1000 czk with the Basic VAT type - the first line will get the Total amount = 700, the second line Total amount = 300
